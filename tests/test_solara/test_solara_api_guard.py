"""Two private solara APIs are load-bearing; their loss must be loud at import.

``solara.scope.get_kernel_id`` and ``solara._using_solara_server`` are not part
of solara's public surface, so a rename can land in a patch release. Losing the
first one is the dangerous case: ``resolve_scope_id`` would raise
``UnsupportedSolaraRuntimeError``, ``current_scope_id`` would answer
``PROCESS_SCOPE``, and every connection in a multi-user container would share
one scope for theme, UI state and the notification bus.

Each module is re-executed into a *fresh* module object rather than reloaded,
so a failing import cannot leave the live ``pysepal.solara`` half-built.
