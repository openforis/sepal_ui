"""DEV_AUTH mimics production topology: one session per connection.

``PYSEPAL_DEV_AUTH`` exists so a developer can run the real app-launcher shape
locally. That only works if the *scoping* matches production too: a session per
connection, torn down with its kernel. A process-wide session makes three
browser tabs look like one user, hides every per-connection fault until it
reaches SEPAL, and leaves interfaces (and the loop-bound HTTP clients they own)
alive across page reloads.

The developer *login* stays process-cached -- it is a blocking HTTP POST, and
there is only one developer identity. Only the session is per connection.
