"""A session-less ``GEEInterface`` is refused where the process serves many users.

Since 4.0 every method goes through the session; there is no global-``ee``
branch left. An interface built with no session resolves one from
``~/.config/earthengine/credentials`` instead -- the platform service-account
key in an app-launcher container -- so the refusal moved to the constructor,
which is also the only place that knows the runtime topology. It lives there
rather than in each caller because ``gee_interface or GEEInterface()`` appears
in five places across four subpackages, and that list only grows.

Resolution itself is lazy; the guard is not. See
``test_construction_does_not_resolve_credentials`` for why.
