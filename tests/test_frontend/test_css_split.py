"""Guards for the shared/base CSS split.

pysepal ships one shared stylesheet (``frontend/css/base.css``) consumed by
BOTH runtimes: the ipyvuetify/Voila runtime (injected by
``frontend.styles.get_custom_css``) and the Solara runtime (merged in by
``asset_merger``). Only rules that must differ per runtime live in the thin
override files (``frontend/css/custom.css`` for Voila,
``solara/common/assets/custom.css`` for Solara).

These tests pin the split so the two sheets cannot silently drift apart again
(the historical failure mode: PR #968 forked a copy, later one-sided edits
diverged them, and parity had to be chased by hand).
