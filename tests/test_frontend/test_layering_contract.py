"""Guards for the modal layering contract.

pysepal's floating chrome (map, app bar, legend, task pill) must stay BELOW
Vuetify's modal baseline. Vuetify derives a dialog's z-index at runtime -- the
``stackable`` mixin reads computed z-indexes off the DOM -- so any app layer
that outranks it has to be beaten with ``!important``, which desynchronises that
bookkeeping and silently breaks click-outside-to-close.

The historical failure mode: the fullscreen map sat at 800, above Vuetify's
~201 scrim, so an outside click landed on the map and ``click:outside`` never
fired. Every workaround that pinned ``.v-overlay`` or ``.v-dialog__content``
from CSS traded that bug for a worse one (the dialog rendering behind its own
scrim). The fix was to renumber the app's own layers underneath instead.
