"""All modules used to create a application ``Map``.

The ``SepalMap`` is inheriting from the **ipyleaflet** ``Map``. It has been customized to support additional widgets as controls based on **ipyvuetify**. It is also fully compatible with the **pysepal** framework thanks to frontend modifications.

The main object is the ``SepalMap`` that should be used in favor of ``Map`` in **pysepal** framework. The others are pre-designed controls that can be helpful to speed up developments.
``SepalMap`` is fully compatible with Google Earth Engine layers.

Every module content can be called directly from the package.

Example:
    .. jupyter-execute::

        from pysepal import mapping as sm

        sm.SepalMap(gee=False)
