"""Prepare a raster for fast tile serving.

``rio-tiler`` reads full-resolution pixels for every tile when the source has no
overviews, so low zooms are slow and each tile logs a ``NoOverviewWarning``.
:func:`prepare_for_tiles` returns a tiled COG with overviews, kept in a cache
directory and reused on later calls, and is a fast no-op when the raster is
already good enough.

Everything runs through rasterio's own GDAL rather than the ``gdal_translate``
/ ``gdaladdo`` / ``gdalwarp`` binaries: those cannot be declared as a dependency
-- they are not on PyPI -- so a ``pip install`` would silently fall back to
serving unprepared, unprojected rasters.

``rasterio`` is imported inside the functions that need it. ``pysepal.mapping``
pulls this module in, and importing rasterio costs ~160ms, which an app that only
draws Earth Engine layers should not pay to display a map.
