"""Runtime topology: where a session's credentials may legitimately come from.

A session's credential source is decided by *runtime topology* -- what kind of
process pysepal is running in -- and never by probing credentials or by testing
whether a request happens to carry headers. The rule, in order:

1. ``PYSEPAL_DEV_AUTH`` is armed and the connection carries no validated SEPAL
   headers: :attr:`SessionSource.DEV_AUTH`, one developer login for the whole
   process. Real headers demote this branch, so a stray environment variable can
   never displace a live user's identity.
2. The process runs in a SEPAL sandbox -- ``SEPAL=true`` in the environment,
   i.e. an app-manager app owned by exactly one user:
   :attr:`SessionSource.PROCESS`.
3. ``PYSEPAL_LOCAL_EE`` is armed and the connection carries no validated SEPAL
   headers: :attr:`SessionSource.PROCESS`, from the machine's own Earth Engine
   credentials. For a developer running a GEE-only app under ``solara run``
   with no SEPAL instance to log in to.
4. The process runs under a Solara server -- an app-launcher multi-user
   container: :attr:`SessionSource.PER_CONNECTION`.
5. Anything else -- Voila, plain Jupyter, a script, pytest:
   :attr:`SessionSource.PROCESS`.

:attr:`SessionSource.PER_CONNECTION` never falls back. An app-launcher container
mounts the *platform* GEE service-account key at
``~/.config/earthengine/credentials`` (``ee.Initialize()`` requires it there),
and that is exactly the path ``eeclient.providers.resolve_default_provider``
reads -- so a headerless fallback in that runtime silently hands every user the
platform service account.

Rule 3 reaches the same credentials, and is not that fallback: it is armed by
hand rather than reached by degradation, real headers demote it exactly as they
demote rule 1, and the file it resolves is refused underneath us --
``resolve_default_provider(allow_service_account_file=False)`` raises
``ServiceAccountFileRefusedError`` on a service-account key, and in a
``sepal-user`` home it takes the SEPAL-file-only branch where a service-account
JSON fails ``GoogleTokens`` validation. The container this rule exists to
protect therefore fails closed on all three counts. It is placed below rule 2 so
that a real sandbox always answers with its own credentials.

This rule governs the session layer, not the whole package.
``pysepal.scripts.gee.init_ee`` reads ``~/.config/earthengine/credentials``
directly, branches on ``type == "service_account"`` and calls
``ee.Initialize()``; a ``GEEInterface`` built with no session then routes every
call through that global ``ee``. Two public defaults still reach it --
``solara.components.aoi.admin.process_admin(..., gee=True)`` with no
``gee_interface``, and ``SepalMap(gee=True)`` likewise -- so in an app-launcher
container both use the platform service account rather than the caller's
identity. pysepal's own render paths pass ``get_current_gee_interface()``, so
nothing here regresses; the gap is in the public API and predates this rule.

These names are private on purpose: exporting the enum in a major release
freezes its members, and this is the enum most likely to gain a case.

    The two failure directions are not symmetric: a false positive here steers
    a multi-user container onto PROCESS and silently shares one identity across
    every user, so this predicate must stay tight.

    A false negative is milder, but it is not uniformly loud -- that depends on
    the caller. Rule 2 of :func:`resolve_session_plan` steers a real sandbox
    onto PER_CONNECTION, which raises on missing headers. The other reader,
    :meth:`SessionManager._process_sepal_client`, instead returns no client and
    degrades to ``export_hook``'s local-filesystem fallback: a sandbox whose app
    process did not export ``SEPAL`` would write exports to container-local disk
    rather than the user's SEPAL workspace, with nothing raised. Worth knowing
    because ``/etc/environment`` is applied at login and is not inherited by a
    container entrypoint; checked on a live sandbox, an app process does see the
    variable.

    That asymmetry is why this reads the environment rather than the home
    directory name. Only the sandbox image sets ``SEPAL`` -- the
    geospatial-toolkit build writes it into ``/etc/environment``, and its
    ``sandbox-base`` parent does not -- so an app-launcher app container built
    on ``sandbox-base`` inherits a ``sepal-user`` home but no ``SEPAL``. Under
    the home-name predicate that container was a false positive.

    Only the exact value ``true`` counts, matching
    :func:`pysepal.scripts.scratch.on_sepal`, the other reader of this
    variable. That is stricter than :func:`dev_auth_enabled` on purpose:
    ``PYSEPAL_DEV_AUTH`` is typed by a developer, ``SEPAL`` is written by the
    platform.

    ``eeclient.providers._is_sepal_context()`` still matches ``"sepal-user"``
    against the home directory name, and gates ``resolve_default_provider()``'s
    fail-closed SEPAL-file-only branch. The two predicates now read different
    signals and disagree in exactly the container above, where ee-client keeps
    the old false positive; moving it onto ``SEPAL`` is a separate release.
