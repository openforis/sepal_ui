"""One scope-keyed registry for every per-connection object pysepal holds.

UI state, the notification bus and ``SessionManager`` all key state by scope
id. They used to disagree about what "no runtime" means -- one fell back to
the process scope, one raised, one did both depending on the method. There is
one default now, and it is the topology rule's: no per-connection runtime
*is* the process scope. A registry over a credential store configures the
strict resolver instead -- there, a wrong scope is a cross-user leak, not a
shared bucket.

Two policies, split deliberately. *Resolution* is configured per instance, via
``resolver=``. *Lifetime* is not configurable here at all -- it stays the
caller's, because the three consumers disagree and always will:

- plain drop -- ``ui_state`` removes a scope's state on the first release;
- refcount -- ``notifications.bus`` keeps a bus until the last mount releases it;
- tombstone -- ``SessionManager`` remembers a closed scope so it cannot be
  resurrected.

This registry therefore has no opinion on *when* a value goes, only on how it
is keyed and locked. A consumer layers its own policy on
:meth:`ScopeRegistry.scope_lock` and drives it with the plain accessors --
folding those three policies back in here as flags would recreate the
per-caller tangle this class exists to remove.
