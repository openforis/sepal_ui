# Solara Export with pysepal

> Use this guide when a pysepal Solara app needs to let users export an
> `ee.Image` or `ee.FeatureCollection` to an Earth Engine asset, Google Drive,
> or the SEPAL workspace.

## What the Export Component Is

The export component is a single launcher button plus a modal dialog that
drives an async submission engine. It is designed to be dropped into any
pysepal Solara app that has GEE-produced layers users might want to take out
of the app.

It provides:

- one `ExportLauncher` button that opens a dialog
- a dialog that offers Earth Engine asset / Google Drive / SEPAL workspace as
  destinations, with kind-appropriate options (image scale or table format)
- an async engine that handles folder creation, task submission, Drive
  staging for SEPAL targets, and cleanup
- a controller hook (`use_export_dialog`) for when you need to drive the
  dialog from a custom layout instead of the default launcher button
- per-source deferred resolution so heavy `ee` computations only fire when
  the user actually presses Export

It does **not** provide:

- `ee.ImageCollection` export — host apps must collapse to a single
  `ee.Image` (e.g. with `.toBands()` or `.mosaic()`) before passing in
- interactive visualization or symbology editing
- a replacement for custom export flows that have their own UX
  requirements — the controller hook is the extension point

## Core Pieces

The public surface lives in `pysepal.solara.components.export`:

- `ExportLauncher` — the drop-in button + dialog component
- `ExportSource` — dataclass declaring one exportable layer
- `ResolvedExport` — dataclass returned by an `ExportSource.resolve()` call;
  carries the concrete `ee` object and per-source defaults
- `use_export_dialog(sources, …)` — controller hook (advanced layouts)
- `ExportDialog` — the modal UI (used by `ExportLauncher`; also composable)
- `submit_export_request(request, …)` — headless async submitter
- `ExportResult` — structured return after a successful submission
- `TABLE_FILE_FORMATS`, `DEFAULT_TABLE_FILE_FORMAT`,
  `DEFAULT_IMAGE_FILE_FORMAT` — canonical file-format constants

Conceptually:

1. The parent declares a tuple of `ExportSource` objects.
2. The parent renders `ExportLauncher(sources=...)`.
3. The user clicks the button, picks an asset and destination, presses
   Export.
4. The engine submits the EE task and (for SEPAL targets) copies the
   result file(s) from Drive into the workspace.
5. A success/error toast is published through `NotificationProvider`.

## Quickstart: One Source, One Button

```python
import ee
import solara

from pysepal.solara.components.export import ExportLauncher, ExportSource, ResolvedExport
from pysepal.solara.notifications import NotificationProvider


@solara.component
def ExportsPanel(aoi: solara.Reactive[ee.Geometry]):
    def _resolve_elevation() -> ResolvedExport:
        dem = ee.Image("USGS/SRTMGL1_003").clip(aoi.value)
        return ResolvedExport(
            ee_object=dem,
            default_name="SRTM_elevation",
            region=aoi.value,
            default_scale=30,
        )

    sources = (
        ExportSource(
            id="srtm-elevation",
            label="SRTM elevation (m)",
            kind="image",
            resolve=_resolve_elevation,
        ),
    )

    ExportLauncher(sources=sources, button_text=True)
```

Drop `NotificationProvider()` once in your app shell so the dialog has a
place to publish success and error toasts. The notifications guide covers
that pattern in full: see [`solara-notifications.md`](solara-notifications.md).

## Declaring an `ExportSource`

`ExportSource` is the parent-owned description of one exportable layer.

```python
ExportSource(
    id="elevation",              # stable identifier, used as the Select value
    label="SRTM elevation",       # user-visible label in the dropdown
    kind="image",                 # "image" or "table" — must match what resolve() returns
    resolve=_resolve_elevation,   # 0-arg callable, runs when user presses Export
    description="",               # optional, currently unused in UI
    disabled=False,               # greyed out in the Select when True
    icon="",                       # optional mdi- icon name for future use
)
```

Key rule: **`resolve` is called lazily**, not at mount. This is deliberate —
your factory can stitch together `ee` objects that depend on the live AOI or
other reactive state, and the computation only fires when the user commits
to an export. Keep the factory pure-ish: it should return a `ResolvedExport`
or raise on a clear error.

If `resolve()` raises, the dialog surfaces the exception message via the
notification system (falling back to an inline `solara.Warning` when no
provider is mounted).

## What `ResolvedExport` Carries

`ResolvedExport` is the concrete payload the engine needs to submit the job.

```python
ResolvedExport(
    ee_object=ee_object,             # ee.Image or ee.FeatureCollection
    default_name="my_export",         # leaf name; pre-fills the Asset ID (GEE)
                                       # or the Export name field (Drive/SEPAL)
    region=aoi.value,                 # optional, used for image exports
    default_scale=30,                 # optional, used for image exports
    selectors=("ADM0_NAME",),          # optional, pre-baked subset (bypasses the picker)
    bands=("B4", "B3", "B2"),          # optional catalog; renders the picker (see below)
    default_bands=("B4", "B3"),       # optional initial selection; defaults to all bands
    gee_folder="my_module",           # optional folder segment under the user's
                                       # asset root; feeds the auto-filled Asset ID
                                       # (e.g. projects/<project>/assets/my_module/<name>).
                                       # Pass an absolute "projects/.../assets/..." path
                                       # to override the root.
    drive_folder="",                  # optional, Drive folder name
    sepal_folder="exports",           # optional, relative to module_results
    table_file_format="SHP",         # canonical enum; see below
    image_file_format="GEO_TIFF",    # canonical enum; see below
    max_pixels=1_000_000_000,
    max_vertices=None,
    priority=None,
    vis_params=None,                  # optional SEPAL viz to embed on image exports
)
```

The user can override any destination-related field in the dialog. The
`default_*` values just pre-fill the controls.

## Band Selection

Every **image** export gets a band picker automatically: when a source
does not declare a catalog, the dialog fetches the image's band names
from Earth Engine (`image.bandNames()`) and renders the multi-select
picker regardless of band count — a spinner stands in while the names
load. Apps that want a specific order, a subset, or a non-default initial
selection can still declare a catalog explicitly (see below); a declared
catalog skips discovery. **Tables** never auto-discover — declare a
catalog to expose a property picker.

The user-selected subset is threaded through `ExportRequest.selectors`
and applied by the engine:

- **Images** → `image.select(selectors)` is applied to the EE object
  before submission (the image-export endpoints do not accept a
  `selectors` parameter, so it has to be baked into the image).
- **Tables** → `selectors=` is passed straight through to
  `Export.table.toAsset` / `Export.table.toDrive`, which is how Earth
  Engine selects feature properties.

Declare the catalog on the source:

```python
ExportSource(
    id="landsat_composite",
    label="Landsat composite",
    kind="image",
    resolve=lambda: ResolvedExport(
        ee_object=composite,
        default_name="landsat_composite",
        region=aoi.geometry(),
        default_scale=30,
        bands=("B4", "B3", "B2", "B5", "B6", "B7"),    # full catalog
        default_bands=("B4", "B3", "B2"),               # initial selection
    ),
)
```

Rules:

- `bands=None` (the default) auto-discovers the catalog for **image**
  sources (the picker always renders, 1 band or many) and hides the
  picker for **table** sources. A failed discovery (permissions, network)
  degrades to no picker and exports the full image.
- `bands=(...)` renders the picker labelled **Bands** for images,
  **Properties** for tables, and skips auto-discovery.
- `default_bands` is optional; when omitted, every band is selected by
  default. Entries that are not in `bands` are dropped silently.
- The picker preserves catalog order — even if the user clicks them in
  a different order, the submitted `selectors` come back ordered by
  `bands`.
- Empty selection is rejected (Submit stays disabled; trying to call
  `submit_export` programmatically raises `ValueError`).
- Pre-baked `selectors=(...)` is the legacy escape hatch for apps that
  manage band selection outside the dialog. When `bands` is declared,
  the picker overrides `selectors`.

### Auto-discovery cost

Discovery calls `image.bandNames().getInfo()` once per selected source
(the result is cached per source for the life of the dialog). This reads
the image's **band schema, not its pixels**, so it is independent of how
spatially large, high-resolution, or deeply chained the image is —
`select`, `rename`, `addBands`, arithmetic, `mosaic`, and reducers all
propagate band names structurally. In practice it is a single metadata
round-trip to Earth Engine (typically sub-second; occasionally 1–2s of
network latency). The cost tracks _schema_ complexity, not pixel volume,
so a "huge" image is not a problem.

The one operation that can be slow is `imageCollection.toBands()`, whose
output band count is `images × bands-per-image` — Earth Engine has to
enumerate the whole collection to name the bands. Raw `ee.ImageCollection`
inputs are rejected by the export anyway, so this only bites if a source
hands in a `toBands()` result over a large collection. Plain `mosaic()` /
reducers are fine (fixed schema).

While discovery is in flight:

- The picker shows a spinner and the **Export button is disabled**
  (`bands_loading`), so a slow `bandNames()` delays _Export_, not the
  dialog opening.
- Any failure (permissions, network) is swallowed — the picker is hidden
  and the full image is exported unchanged.

To skip the round-trip entirely — for a known band set, or a source where
`bandNames()` would be expensive — **declare `bands=(...)`** on the
`ResolvedExport`. A declared catalog renders instantly and never calls
Earth Engine.

Discovery is cached per source id, not per resolved image (`resolve()`
returns a fresh object every render, so caching on the object would refetch
constantly). A source whose `resolve()` changes its **band set** under the
same id — unusual, since `clip`/`filter`/AOI changes preserve band names —
therefore keeps its first-discovered catalog. If a source genuinely swaps
its bands under one id, give it a distinct id per variant or declare
`bands=(...)` so the picker tracks the change.

Heads-up on visualization: if you set both `vis_params` and `bands`, the
viz dict can reference bands the user deselects. The engine applies
`set_viz_params` first and then `image.select(...)`, so the embedded
visualization properties may point at bands missing from the exported
asset. Apps that mix the two should keep `vis_params.bands` inside the
band catalog or warn users in the source description.

## Carrying SEPAL Visualization Onto Exports

When an app renders a styled `ee.Image` on the map and then exports the
underlying classification (e.g. with `SepalMap.add_ee_layer(image, vis_params)`),
the exported Earth Engine asset will not carry that styling — `vis_params`
lives on the `EELayer`, not on the image. SEPAL's convention is to encode
styling as image properties named `visualization_<index>_<key>`; SepalMap
reads them on display, and Earth Engine asset exports preserve them, so any
downstream consumer (another SEPAL recipe, the Code Editor) sees the styling
automatically.

Pass `vis_params` to `ResolvedExport` to opt into this:

```python
GFC_VIS_PARAMS = {
    "name": "loss_year",
    "type": "categorical",
    "bands": ["classification"],
    "palette": HEX_PALETTE,
    "values": [*range(1, GFC_MAX_YEAR + 1), 30, 40, 50, 51],
    "labels": ["loss 2001", ..., "non forest", "stable forest", "gain", "gain + loss"],
}

ExportSource(
    id="gfc_classified",
    label="GFC classified image",
    kind="image",
    resolve=lambda: ResolvedExport(
        ee_object=classification,
        default_name="gfc",
        region=aoi.geometry(),
        default_scale=30,
        vis_params=GFC_VIS_PARAMS,
    ),
)
```

The dict shape mirrors the kwargs of
`pysepal.mapping.visualization.set_viz_params` (the writer; inverse of
`get_viz_params` used by SepalMap on display). Keys:

| Key        | Type                                              | Notes                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | `str`                                             | Logical name. Defaults to `"default"`.                  |
| `type`     | `"continuous" \| "categorical" \| "rgb" \| "hsv"` | SepalMap infers from band count when omitted.           |
| `bands`    | `Sequence[str]`                                   | One band for continuous/categorical; three for rgb/hsv. |
| `min`      | scalar or `Sequence[float]`                       | Per-band minimum(s).                                    |
| `max`      | scalar or `Sequence[float]`                       | Per-band maximum(s).                                    |
| `palette`  | `Sequence[str]` or comma-joined string            | Hex colors.                                             |
| `values`   | `Sequence[int]`                                   | Categorical class codes (palette[i] maps to values[i]). |
| `labels`   | `Sequence[str]`                                   | Legend labels.                                          |
| `inverted` | `Sequence[bool]`                                  | Per-band inversion flags.                               |

Only applies to image-kind exports; ignored on table-kind sources. For
multiple named visualizations on the same image, write them eagerly via
`set_viz_params(image, ..., index=N)` before passing to `ResolvedExport`.

## Destinations

The dialog offers three destinations, each enabled based on runtime state:

- **Earth Engine asset** (`gee`) — default. Submits
  `projects.image.export` / `projects.table.export` to the user's EE project
  asset root. The dialog shows a single editable **Asset ID** field
  pre-filled with the full path
  (`projects/<project>/assets/<folder>/<sanitized-name>`). The user can
  edit any segment — the validation rules below catch invalid input.
- **Google Drive** (`drive`) — submits a Drive export task; no waiting for
  completion inside the dialog. Shown as separate **Export name** +
  **Google Drive folder** fields.
- **SEPAL workspace** (`sepal`) — requires a session-backed `SepalClient`.
  Exports to Drive first, waits for completion, downloads the files, and
  uploads them under `<module_results>/<sepal_folder>/`. Disabled (greyed
  out) when `sepal_client` is None — i.e. when the app is not running
  inside a SEPAL session.

SEPAL workspace exports must stay on the `SepalClient` path. Do not stage,
copy, or rewrite user export files in the container filesystem from host app
code; let the export engine download bytes from Drive and upload them through
`sepal_client.files.write(...)`.

The engine creates any missing intermediate folders under the user's asset
root before submitting an EE asset export.

## Asset ID Validation (GEE target)

The GEE target enforces three rules on the asset id, each surfaced as an
inline error on the Asset ID field (which also disables the Export button)
and re-enforced by `submit_export_request` at submit time so programmatic
callers are protected:

- **Required** — empty asset id raises `ValueError("Earth Engine export requires an asset id.")`.
- **Root** — the asset id must live under
  `projects/<user-project>/assets/`. Editing the project, dropping the
  `assets/` segment, or pointing at `users/...` raises
  `ValueError("Asset id must live under \`projects/<project>/assets/\`.")`. The shared helper is `validate_asset_id_under_root`.
- **Conflict** — a debounced (350 ms) `get_asset_async` probe flags
  pre-existing assets in the dialog. The engine re-checks at submit and
  raises `FileExistsError` as the authoritative guard, so concurrent
  creations between the live check and submit cannot silently overwrite.

Drive and SEPAL exports skip all three (Drive allows duplicate filenames
natively; SEPAL writes through `files.write(..., overwrite=True)`).

## File Formats: Use Canonical Enum Values

ee-client's pydantic models validate file formats strictly. **Use the
canonical REST-API enum strings**, not the human-friendly sepal_ui names:

| What users see | What to store as `value` |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| GeoTIFF        | `"GEO_TIFF"`             |
| GeoJSON        | `"GEO_JSON"`             |
| Shapefile      | `"SHP"`                  |
| CSV            | `"CSV"`                  |
| KML / KMZ      | `"KML"` / `"KMZ"`        |

The constants `DEFAULT_IMAGE_FILE_FORMAT = "GEO_TIFF"` and
`DEFAULT_TABLE_FILE_FORMAT = "SHP"` already use the canonical values;
`TABLE_FILE_FORMATS` maps friendly text labels to canonical values so users
still see `"GeoJSON"` in the dropdown but the wire payload is `"GEO_JSON"`.

Requires **ee-client >= 2.5.2** (enforced by pyproject.toml). 2.5.1 had a
bug where the table→asset serializer emitted `driveExportOptions` for asset
exports; 2.5.2 renamed it to `assetExportOptions`.

## Multiple Sources

Pass a tuple with more than one entry and the dialog groups them by kind in
the Asset dropdown, with subheaders and a divider between `Images` and
`Feature collections`:

```python
sources = (
    ExportSource(id="dem",    label="Elevation (DEM)", kind="image", resolve=_resolve_dem),
    ExportSource(id="slope",  label="Slope (degrees)",  kind="image", resolve=_resolve_slope),
    ExportSource(id="aoi",    label="AOI polygons",      kind="table", resolve=_resolve_aoi),
    ExportSource(id="points", label="Sample points",     kind="table", resolve=_resolve_points),
)
ExportLauncher(sources=sources, button_text=True)
```

When only one kind is present, the grouping and subheader are suppressed
and the list renders flat — no need to do anything special for single-kind
apps.

To keep a layer visible but non-selectable (e.g., not ready yet), set
`disabled=True` on that `ExportSource`.

## The Dialog Body is Always Visible

When no asset is selected, the Destination radio and the target-appropriate
input fields render but are disabled — Asset ID for the GEE target, Export
name + Google Drive folder for Drive/SEPAL. The rationale is that users
should see the structure of the form before committing to a selection — it
telegraphs which options exist.

Kind-specific widgets (image scale presets, table file format) only appear
after a source is selected, because they are mutually exclusive — showing
both would be misleading.

The Export button stays disabled until a source is selected, the target
input is non-empty, and (for the GEE target) the asset id passes the root
and conflict checks described above.

## Custom Layouts: `use_export_dialog`

When the default `ExportLauncher` button doesn't fit — e.g., you want the
trigger to live inside a toolbar menu, or you need to render the dialog
from multiple trigger points — use the controller hook directly:

```python
from pysepal.solara.components.export import ExportDialog, use_export_dialog

@solara.component
def CustomExportsToolbar(sources):
    controller = use_export_dialog(sources=sources)

    solara.Button(
        label="Export…",
        icon_name="mdi-tray-arrow-down",
        on_click=controller.open_dialog,
    )
    ExportDialog(controller=controller, title="Export layers")
```

`ExportDialogController` exposes everything you might want to drive from the
outside:

- `open` / `open_dialog()` / `close_dialog()` — dialog open state
- `selected_target` / `selected_source_id` / `export_name` — reactive inputs
- `task` — the underlying `solara.lab.use_task` handle (for pending/finished)
- `result` — the last `ExportResult`
- `submit_export()` / `cancel_export()` — programmatic controls
- `sources` — the resolved tuple of `ExportSource`

Keep the hook invocation unconditional at the top of the component — it
registers solara reactives and effects per the usual rules of hooks.

## Notifications and Timeouts

On submission outcome the dialog publishes one toast through the notifier
returned by `use_notifications()`:

- success → `Notifier.success(message, timeout=EXPORT_SUCCESS_TOAST_TIMEOUT)`
- error → `Notifier.error(exception_message)`
- cancel → `Notifier.cancel("Export cancelled.")` (or a local-wait message
  if the remote task is still running)

The success toast uses a longer timeout (8s by default, vs the 3s global
default) because it carries a copyable asset path or task id. Tune the
constant in `pysepal/solara/components/export_hook.py:EXPORT_SUCCESS_TOAST_TIMEOUT`
if your app wants a different duration.

All `Notifier` methods accept an optional `timeout` kwarg for per-call
control:

```python
notifications = use_notifications()
notifications.success("Export submitted", timeout=12.0)
notifications.warning("Almost done…")  # uses type default (3s)
```

When no `NotificationProvider` is mounted, the dialog falls back to an
inline `solara.Success` / `solara.Error` / etc. rendered inside the card.

## The Modal Stays Open After Success

The dialog does NOT auto-close when the task completes. This is
intentional: users often want to copy the resulting asset path, note the
task id, or fire off a second export with slightly different options.
Users close the dialog themselves.

If your app needs the old auto-close behavior, set `controller.open.value = False`
inside your own `use_effect` watching `controller.result.value`.

## Testing Components That Render `ExportLauncher`

Two test-side helpers live in `tests/test_solara/test_export_component.py`:

```python
def _render(factory, *args, **kwargs):
    """Render a Solara widget with a running event loop so ``use_task`` can schedule."""
    async def _runner():
        return factory(*args, **kwargs)
    return asyncio.run(_runner())


def _render_preselected_dialog(source, *, target="gee"):
    """Render ExportDialog with a source preselected and the dialog open."""
    @solara.component
    def _Harness():
        controller = use_export_dialog(
            sources=[source],
            gee_interface=MagicMock(),
            drive_interface=MagicMock(),
        )
        def _preselect():
            controller.selected_source_id.set(source.id)
            controller.selected_target.set(target)
            controller.open.set(True)
        solara.use_effect(_preselect, [])
        return ExportDialog(controller=controller, title="Test")
    async def _runner():
        return _Harness.widget()
    return asyncio.run(_runner())
```

Key points:

- `.widget()` in a synchronous test fails with
  `RuntimeError: no running event loop` because Solara's `use_task`
  schedules via `asyncio.create_task`. Wrap the render in `asyncio.run` to
  provide a loop during the mount.
- Post-selection contracts (e.g. "destination is a RadioGroup", "image
  scale uses BtnToggle not a Slider") require the dialog to be in a
  selected state. The preselection harness drives the controller there
  before the walk.

## Wire Into the Default Scaffold

When scaffolding a new pysepal Solara app that produces exportable GEE
layers:

- mount `NotificationProvider()` once in the app shell (see the
  notifications guide)
- collect the app's exportable layers into a tuple of `ExportSource`
  objects, with `resolve` reading from your AppState or props
- drop `ExportLauncher(sources=sources)` into the right side panel or
  toolbar — use `button_text=True` inside collapsible panels where the
  pysepal convention is `small=True, block=True`
- avoid building a second custom export UX unless the dialog cannot cover
  your requirements; in that case prefer the `use_export_dialog` hook over
  re-implementing submission logic

The reference integration lives in `demo_apps/solara_map_app/`:
`component/scripts/exports.py` declares the sources and
`component/tile/export.py` mounts the launcher.
