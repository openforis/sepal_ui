"""Landing page for the pysepal demos: one Solara server, one route per app.

Every demo keeps its entrypoint at ``app.py`` so it stays runnable on its own,
which means a plain ``import app`` would resolve to whichever demo was imported
first. Loading by path under the demo's own name avoids that collision, and
putting the demo's directory on ``sys.path`` is what lets ``from component...``
inside it resolve exactly as it does when Solara runs the demo directly.

To run:

```bash
pysepal$ ./run_solara.sh demo_apps/gallery.py --port 8901
```
