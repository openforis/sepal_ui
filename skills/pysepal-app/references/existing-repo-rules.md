# Existing Repo Rules

Use these rules whenever the user wants scaffolding inside an existing repository.

## Safe Edit Rules

- Never overwrite entrypoints or environment files silently.
- Prefer patching in place when the existing file already follows pysepal conventions.
- Prefer adding adjacent files when replacing the existing file would destroy user-specific behavior.
- If the repository already contains unrelated or conflicting user work, stop and explain the conflict before proceeding.

## What To Inspect First

Inspect these before editing:

- existing entrypoints such as `solara_app.py`, `app.py`, or notebooks
- current dependency files
- current environment files
- current docker files if present
- current component tree

## When To Stop And Ask

Stop and ask if:

- the repo mixes incompatible patterns and the migration path is ambiguous
- existing files already implement the same responsibilities with a different architecture
- the requested scaffold would require deleting meaningful user code
